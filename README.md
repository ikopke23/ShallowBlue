# ShallowBlue
 Chess using Java - Made for my Junior year of Highschool

# To start the game you compile and run!
```
javac Player.java
java Player
```
That should automatically compile each imported file which will spawn a bunch of class files


## Issues
 - Bottom right diagonal is not checking if pieces are interposing check
 - No way to reset board
 - En can move into check, or can move a piece that is being pinned
